# Duet 3 Configuration for MPCNC Primo

I wanted to create a repository for my configuration as I iterate through getting everything set up.

## Current state: In progress and somewhat working.

I have been having some issues with getting homing to work with the dual motors, will update this as soon as I figure it all out.
